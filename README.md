# NOTE-TAKER
## Description
https://calm-tor-71168.herokuapp.com/
This is a simple note-taking application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes. It provides an interface for users to interact with their notes, and stores the notes in a JSON file. The application uses Node.js and Express to handle server-side operations, and stores the notes using the built-in file system module. It also makes use of the uuid package to generate unique IDs for each note.
